    "## Introduction\n",
    "In our project, we explored the Motor Vehicles Collisions dataset which comes from the city of New York. The dataset contains information on motor vehicle crashes that occured from 2012-2013. \n",
    "\n",
    "Motor crashes are a major public health and safety concern, particularly in urban areas with high traffic volumes such as New York City. In recent years, the city has seen a significant increase in the number of motor crashes, leading to a growing concern about their impact on public safety, transportation infrastructure, and economic productivity. To address these concerns, data analysis can play a crucial role in identifying the factors that contribute to motor crashes and developing effective strategies for prevention and mitigation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper aims to analyze the data on motor crashes in New York City over the past few years, with a focus on identifying the key factors associated with these incidents and proposing actionable solutions to reduce their frequency and severity. We aim to find a relationship between the data included and how severe the crashes are for people. We hope the anlaysis conducted in the project will lead key descion makers to improving safety and road rules.\n",
